# LAN-email-sys-prototype
shit to be added to VoltOS




so this should be able to work on windows to be able to send strings over LAN via the socket python library. download both the server and client. 
the client recieves and the server sends. im working on the client being able to send, so for now take a pair. only run one copy of a program on the same ip at a time
if your friend sent mail via server while you had the server open., it would break. same with client.

# NOTE: DISCONTINUED: YOU DON'T NEED BOTH SERVER AND CLIENT. EVERYTHING HERE IS KINDA DUMB.
